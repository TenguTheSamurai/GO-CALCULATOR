# üßÆ Go Calculator

A command-line **Calculator written in Go** that supports a variety of basic arithmetic operations, including:

* Addition (`+`)
* Subtraction (`-`)
* Multiplication (`*`)
* Division (`/`)
* Modulo (`%`)
* Exponentiation (`^`)
* Square Root (`sqrt`)

It also features:

* **Input validation**
* **Error handling**
* **Command history tracking**
* **Continuous operation loop**
* **History clearing**

## üöÄ Features

‚úÖ Basic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
‚úÖ Advanced operators: `%`, `^`, `sqrt`
‚úÖ Square root of any positive number
‚úÖ Command history tracking
‚úÖ Interactive loop ‚Äì runs until you type `exit`
‚úÖ Clear history with `clear` command
‚úÖ User-friendly prompts and error messages

## üí° Usage

After compiling and running the program:

```
Enter first number:
> 10

Enter second number:
> 2

Enter operator (+, -, *, /, %, ^, sqrt) or write 'exit' to quit, 'history' to view past results, or 'clear' to erase history:
> +
Result: 12.00
```

You can also:

* Type `sqrt` to get the square root of the first number.
* Type `history` to see all previous calculations.
* Type `clear` to remove all stored history.
* Type `exit` to stop the calculator.

## üß† Example Operators

| Operator | Description                     | Example       |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `+`      | Addition                        | `10 + 5 = 15` |
| `-`      | Subtraction                     | `10 - 5 = 5`  |
| `*`      | Multiplication                  | `10 * 5 = 50` |
| `/`      | Division                        | `10 / 5 = 2`  |
| `%`      | Modulo (remainder)              | `10 % 3 = 1`  |
| `^`      | Exponentiation (power)          | `2 ^ 3 = 8`   |
| `sqrt`   | Square root (first number only) | `sqrt(9) = 3` |
